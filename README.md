# Emy - Efficient Mobile web librarY

### Getting Started

EMY is an Efficient Mobile web librarY to create lightweight mobile web applications using HTML5 & CSS3. The goal is not to recreate what JQuery Mobile or Sencha is doing, but to provide an lightweight & simplier alternative for modern platforms.

Emy is fully working on iOS, Android, Blackberry, WindowsPhone and even latest Symbian series & Firefox OS.

### How to create a webapp using Emy

It's a piece of cake! We have a nice [Getting started tutorial](http://www.emy-library.org/documentation.html) on our website for you.
In short, Emy is a single-page application library, which means all "views" are part of the HTML on load. Then its anchor-based navigation mechanism deals with sliding between views, keeping support & sync with the browser/device back button.
